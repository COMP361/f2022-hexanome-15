### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Finding time where all members are available to meet
 * Distributing tasks equally is quite hard. One attempt had 5 separate tasks, but there are 6 of us.
 * Hard to keep track of uploaded files; in communications channels they get lost, in github new updates get missed.


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Jira is extremely convenient for keeping track of who does what, and of deadlines.
 * Despite tasks being assigned to individuals, all should check on eachothers' work in case anything was missed or can be improved.
 * We are underusing github.
