### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Many team members are unfamiliar with JavaFx. JavaFX visual tools tend to use fxml, which most of us don't know at all.
 * Easy to mess up the repository with commits.
 * We bit off more than we should with this milestone, a lot of work that is not needed for demo. Still, it is work we'll have to do eventually, so this isn't a bad thing.


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Both github and javafx take practice. Being able to use it does not mean being good at it.
 * Speaking of github, committing directly to master branch leads to issues with untested features. We should be making changes on dedicated branches, which can be tested by others without compromising master.
 * Others' code is hard to read.


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * None, surprisingly. Then again, it is extremely simple so far, and missing a lot of the interactions that would actually have edge cases and bugs.
 * I guess you can count javafx being annoying to set up and sometimes not working for no reason..


### Contribution statement

 * *Berardelli, Lawrence contributed 18% of the work since last week.*
 * *Fiore, Sofia contributed 16% of the work since last week.*
 * *Hayden, Zach contributed 21% of the work since last week.*
 * *Krishnan, Ojas contributed 15% of the work since last week.*
 * *Léon, Jeff contributed 12% of the work since last week.*
 * *Sklokin, Svyatoslav contributed 18% of the work since last week.*

### Team mood

 * *All is well. Everyone is still intimidated by M4, but M3 looks great. M2 kinda hurts, we were hoping we did better.*
