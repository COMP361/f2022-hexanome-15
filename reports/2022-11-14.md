### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Our google doc was corrupted during submission. (we submitted a pre-final version in case but it was fairly out of date)
 * We didn't really have a cohesive picture of how the application worked before we got to work on the models, so we needed to do several refactors and redo parts of models.
 * Working on the diagram models was a pain due to all the different programs used, and their restrictions. For example, not everyone had acess to a certain editing app, and jetUML files cannot be opened on phone to review them on demand.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Models build off eachother, so we should do them together or at least in teams with cross-review to stay consistent.
 * We need to be much more vocal and communicate more about how we think something works or should work, to ensure we all have an up to date image of the application structure.
 * Operation models take a huge amount of time to produce, and may reveal gaps in the other models, and so team workload should be balanced accordingly.
