### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Finding time where all members are available to meet. This was especially difficult due to reading week because some team members were out of town.
 * Difficult to coordinate with members during reading week and ensure that everyone is updated.
 * Deciding how to distribute tasks is hard. For M2, we decided to create 2 teams of 3 where each team works on either Lobby Service abstractions or Take Turns abstractions. 
   However as of this report, we have not yet decided which use cases each team member should work on.


### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * After receiving feedback for M1, we realized there were a few aspects we missed during the UI design.
 * Everyone needs to check on other's work for each milestone to ensure that nothing is missing or can be improved.
 * After receiving feedback for M1, we realized we were still underutilizing github.


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
