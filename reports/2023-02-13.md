### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * The actions will be more complicated than we thought as some cards requires the player making some choices after the card is purchased.
 * Since there is less structure due to the next milestone being a modeling one, it is hard to organize coding tasks for everyone.
 * It is hard to get the group motivated to work after the winter break.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * A team member must be able to compile their code with maven before committing their changes to git.
 * The repository has specific IDE files that need to be removed
 * We must regularly verify our pom.xml as wrong dependency versions can cause bugs
