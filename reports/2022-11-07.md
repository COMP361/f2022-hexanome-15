### Tasks missed, scheduled for this report

 * Card reservation
 * Noble interactions
 * Token mechanics

### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * Not really "unexpected", but M4 is extremely long and there isn't much time to do it.
 * Likely focused too hard on M3, we implemented much more than required.
 * Unequal git commits due to project init. We expect this to even out soon.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Our maven .pom file not only doesn't compile, but also is actually missing most of the dependencies such as javafx.
 * The project structure does not match the course requirements, in particular the backend is incorrectly placed.
 * Models build off eachother, so we should do them together or at least in teams with cross-review to stay consistent.


### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
