### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * The actions will be more complicated than we thought as some cards requires the player making some choices after the card is purchased.
 * We thought that purchasing and reserving cards worked in the client but it seems like it needs some fixing since it didn't work for the demo.
 * We will quickly have to get to the point where we meet all the M7 requirements.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * A team member must be able to compile their code with maven before committing their changes to git.
 * The repository has specific IDE files that need to be removed
 * We must regularly verify our pom.xml as wrong dependency versions can cause bugs
